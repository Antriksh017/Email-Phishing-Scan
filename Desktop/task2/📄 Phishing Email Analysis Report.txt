📄 Phishing Email Analysis Report
🧾 Email Subject:
Microsoft account password change

📨 Sender Details:
From Name: Support

Email Address: support@msupdate.net

🧑‍💻 Target Account (shown):
ethan@hooksecurity.co

🕵️‍♂️ Purpose of Email:
The email attempts to convince the recipient that their Microsoft account password has been changed. It provides steps to reset the password, review security information, and learn about account security — all common phishing tactics to harvest user credentials.

⚠️ Indicators of Phishing
1. ❌ Suspicious Sender Domain
The sender’s email domain msupdate.net is not affiliated with Microsoft.

Official Microsoft communications typically come from domains such as @microsoft.com or @account.microsoft.com.

2. 🧪 Training/Demo Context
The recipient email (ethan@hooksecurity.co) and the website displaying it (hooksecurity.co) clearly indicate this is a phishing simulation used for security awareness training.

3. 🧠 Fear-Based Social Engineering
The message warns: “If this wasn’t you, your account has been compromised”.

This creates urgency, pressuring the recipient to click on provided links without verifying the source.

4. 🔗 Suspicious Hyperlinks
Multiple links urging the recipient to:

Reset their password

Review security info

Learn about account security

These links may lead to malicious or fake Microsoft login pages to capture credentials.

5. 💬 Generic Content and Language
No personalized greeting or specific references to the recipient beyond the email address.

Phishing emails often use generic language to cast a wide net across users.

6. 🌐 Spoofed Technical Information
Lists a platform (iOS), browser (Safari), IP address, and country — all of which can be easily spoofed to make the email appear legitimate.

7. 📛 Lack of Branding
No Microsoft logo, official footer, or privacy/security notice.

Legitimate Microsoft emails contain proper branding and company disclaimers.

🧯 Risk Level: HIGH
If this were a real attack, clicking any link could lead to:

Credential theft

Account takeover

Sensitive data compromise

✅ Recommended Actions
Do NOT click on any links if unsure of authenticity.

Verify sender email domain and check with IT/security team.

Report the email to your organization's cybersecurity or phishing report system.

Educate users through phishing simulations like this to build awareness.

🏁 Conclusion
This phishing email effectively mimics a Microsoft alert to trick users. However, careful examination reveals multiple red flags — including the fake sender domain, urgency tactics, and lack of personalization. Simulation emails like this play a crucial role in training employees to recognize and report phishing threats.
